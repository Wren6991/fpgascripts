FPGA Scripts
============

A loose collection of scripts I've collected while playing with FPGAs at home. Simulation, synthesis, so forth. All of them are terrible, some of them work.

The most useful one is `listfiles` which provides a simple way of describing source-level dependencies and producing file lists for e.g. a synthesis tool.
